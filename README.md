# Gotta Catch Them All!

Welcome to this repo. Here, I hope to be able to develop and pioneer new Pok√©-tech to be used for the benefit of mankind.

Tasks I'd like you to do:
- See if you can improve on my models, they don't seem to be doing too well :/ 
- More specifically, instead of a multinomial classification problem, instead we decide to do multiple binary classifications and combine the results.
